        <h2>Conscientiousness</h2>
        <p>Conscientiousness describes a personâ€™s ability to regulate their impulse control in order to
            engage
            in goal-directed behaviors (Grohol, 2019). It measures elements such as control, inhibition, and
            persistency of behavior.</p>

                <h4>Conscientiousness vs. Lack of Direction</h4>
            </div>
            <p>Those who score high on conscientiousness can be described as organized, disciplined,
                detail-oriented, thoughtful, and careful. They also have good impulse control, which allows
                them
                to
                complete tasks and achieve goals.

            </p>
            <p>
                Those who score low on conscientiousness may struggle with impulse control, leading to
                difficulty in
                completing tasks and fulfilling goals.

                They tend to be more disorganized and may dislike too much structure. They may also engage
                in
                more
                impulsive and careless behavior.
