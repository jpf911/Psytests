        <h2>Agreeableness</h2>
        <p>Agreeableness refers to how people tend to treat relationships with others. Unlike extraversion
            which
            consists of the pursuit of relationships, agreeableness focuses on peopleâ€™s orientation and
            interactions with others (Ackerman, 2017).</p>

                <h4>Agreeableness vs. Antagonism</h4>
            </div>
            <p>Those high in agreeableness can be described as soft-hearted, trusting, and well-liked. They
                are
                sensitive to the needs of others and are helpful and cooperative. People regard them as
                trustworthy and altruistic.
            </p>
            <p>
                Those low in agreeableness may be perceived as suspicious, manipulative, and uncooperative.
                They
                may be antagonistic when interacting with others, making them less likely to be well-liked
                and
                trusted.
