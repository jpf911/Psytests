        <h2>Neuroticism</h2>
        <p>Neuroticism describes the overall emotional stability of an individual through how they perceive
            the
            world. It takes into account how likely a person is to interpret events as threatening or
            difficult.
        </p>
        <p>It also includes oneâ€™s propensity to experience negative emotions.</p>

                <h4>Neuroticism vs. Emotional Stability</h4>
            </div>
            <p>Those who score high on neuroticism often feel anxious, insecure and self-pitying. They are
                often
                perceived as moody and irritable. They are prone to excessive sadness and low self-esteem.
            </p>
            <p>
                Those who score low on neuroticism are more likely to calm, secure and self-satisfied. They
                are
                less likely to be perceived as anxious or moody. They are more likely to have high
                self-esteem
                and remain resilient.
